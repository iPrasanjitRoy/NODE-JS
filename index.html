        <h2>About Node.js</h2>
        <p>Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows developers to build server-side applications using
            JavaScript. It is built on the V8 JavaScript engine from Google and was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009.
            Node.js has gained widespread popularity in the development community due to its speed, scalability, and
            versatility.</p>

        <h2>Why Use Node.js?</h2>
        <p>There are several compelling reasons to use Node.js for your server-side development:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>JavaScript Everywhere:</strong> Node.js enables you to use JavaScript on both the client and
                server sides, streamlining development and allowing developers to work with a single programming
                language.</li>
            <li><strong>Event-Driven and Non-Blocking:</strong> Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model,
                making it highly efficient and capable of handling a large number of concurrent connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Large Ecosystem:</strong> Node.js has a vast ecosystem of open-source packages available through
                npm (Node Package Manager), making it easy to find and integrate third-party libraries into your
                projects.</li>
            <li><strong>Fast Execution:</strong> The V8 engine used by Node.js compiles JavaScript into native machine
                code, resulting in speedy execution of your applications.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Node.js is designed to be scalable and is often used in building real-time
                applications, such as chat applications, online gaming, and streaming services.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Advantages of Node.js</h2>
        <p>Node.js offers several advantages for developers and businesses:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Its non-blocking I/O and event-driven architecture make it incredibly fast
                and efficient.</li>
            <li><strong>Community Support:</strong> Node.js has a large and active community of developers who
                contribute to its growth and provide a wealth of resources and libraries.</li>
            <li><strong>Cost-Effective:</strong> Using a single language (JavaScript) for both client and server-side
                development can reduce development costs and improve developer productivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Node.js excels at handling concurrent connections, making it a great
                choice for applications that need to scale easily.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Disadvantages of Node.js</h2>
        <p>While Node.js offers many benefits, it may not be the best choice for every project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-Threaded:</strong> Node.js is single-threaded, which means it may not be suitable for
                CPU-intensive tasks that can block the event loop.</li>
            <li><strong>Callback Hell:</strong> Complex asynchronous code can lead to callback hell, a situation where
                deeply nested callbacks can make code hard to read and maintain.</li>
            <li><strong>Less Mature for Some Use Cases:</strong> In some domains, like heavy-duty data processing or
                scientific computing, other languages and runtimes may be more mature and better suited.</li>
        </ul>
